## Preface

Hi there! For christmas I decided to make a pair of fingerless gloves for my boyfriend (a computer programmer & piano player who is always cold). After much debate over what to have on them, I decided to go with the airbender arrow (from Avatar: The Last Air Bender) on black. I looked around at some patterns for guys but didn't find any that were quite satisfactory, so I decided to mix-n-match the bits I liked from various patterns & do some improv to get what I wanted.

A few years ago I made a pair of fingerless gloves for myself using the "Idony Fingerless Gloves" pattern from Ravelry ([See!](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/thedautoforegon/idony-fingerless-gloves)). I really liked this pattern, speicifcally the increase in the palm/thumb area, but it's a bit too feminine for what I'm goin for. I found another pattern specifically for men's gloves & I very much liked the cuff from that pattern.

I felt that if I made an arrow & then sewed it on it would be too bulky, so I did some experimenting to figure out how to make an arrow, here's that:

I wanted to make sure the seam was on the outside edge of the hand, so I decided to use this seamless method, which involves working back & forth as if you were working rows instead of in the round (See Notes/References below). So, **please keep in mind** if you're using this pattern & want to use another method in order to work in the round you will have to do every other line of instructions in reverse!

## Airbender Fingerless Gloves

### Stitches & Terms

* ch = chain
* sl st = slip stitch
* sc = single crochet
* bls = single crochet in back loop only
* inc = increase (two sc in the same st)
* dec = decrease (aka sc2tog)
* [blk] = black yarn (my main colour)
* [blu] = blue yarn (colour of arrow)

### Materials

* Yarn : acrylic cause i'm broke as hell
* Hooks: **F** (3.75mm) & **G** (4.25mm)
* Stitch markers (I use coloured paper clips)

### Guage/Finished Measurements/Sizing

### Notes/References

As I mentioned, much of this pattern is kind of a patchwork of bits of other patterns. I have slightly rephrased & altered some directions in order to reflect what I did. Check out the original patterns here:
* Part 1 is from [Men's Crocheted Fingerless Gloves](http://www.myrecycledbags.com/2012/01/02/mens-crocheted-fingerless-gloves/) by Cindy (aka RecycleCindy)
* Most of Part 2 is from [Idony Fingerless Gloves](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/idony-fingerless-gloves) by Sarah
* As mentioned above, I used Futuregirl's [seamless single crochet tutorial](http://www.futuregirl.com/craft_blog/2009/1/tutorial-seamless-single-crochet-better.aspx)

## Directions

### Pt 1: Cuff Ribbing

This is worked in normal rows using the **F** hook with [blk].
- Leave a long tail & ch 11.
- Row 1: sc in 2nd ch from hook & in each st down to the end. (10)
- Row 2-30: ch 1, bls in each st across (10)
- Repeat row 2 until desired length is reached - I did about 30 rows to make a cuff approx 6.5" around.
  - Leave yarn attached & slip hook out of last st to weave closed the cuff.
- Using the long tail from the beginning, weave closed the cuff by joining the first & last rows.
  - Cindy suggets working in the back loop of the last row & both loops of first row to keep the appearance of the back loop raised stitching.

### Pt 2: Glove Body

- Rnd 1: Slip the **F** hook back into last st of cuff. [blk] Sc evenly along end sts of cuff (30)
  - I used this  [seamless single crochet tutorial](http://www.futuregirl.com/craft_blog/2009/1/tutorial-seamless-single-crochet-better.aspx)
- Rnd 2: [blk] using **G** hook, st in each st. (30)
- Rnd 3: [blk] sc in next 5 sts, [blu] sc in next 5 sts, [blk] sc around. (30 - 5blk, 5blu, 20blk)
- Rnd 4-6: sc around continuing colours from previous row - [blk] in [blk], [blu] in [blu] (30)
- Rnd 7: [blk] sc in next 5 sts, [blu] sc in next 5 sts, [blk] sc in next 4 sts, inc, sc, inc, sc around. (32 - 3 between markers)
    - **IMPORTANT**  Place a stitch marker in the 1st sc of the first inc & the 2nd sc of the second inc. Continue to move your markers up every row. Any time you inc at marker, place markers in new row in this manner.
    - These increases will create the extra room for the palm/thumb.
- Rnd 8: sc around, continuing colours, & inc at each marker. (34 - 5 between markers)
- Rnd 9: repeat rnd 8. (36 - 7 between markers)
- Rnd 10: sc around, continuing colours. (36 - 7 between markers)
- Rnd 11: repeat rnd 8. (38 - 9 between markers)
- Rnd 12: repeat rnd 10. (38 - 9 between markers)
- Rnd 13: repeat rnd 8. (40 - 11 between markers)
- Rnd 14: repeat rnd 10. (40 - 11 between markers)
- Rnd 15: repeat rnd 8. (42 - 13 between markers)
- Rnd 16 repeat rnd 10. (42 - 13 between markers)
- Rnd 17: repeat rnd 8. (44 - 15 between markers)
- Rnd 18: repeat rnd 10. (44 - 15 between markers)
- Rnd 19: [blk] sc in next 2 sts, [blu] sc in next 11 sts, [blk] sc around. (44 - 15 between markers)
