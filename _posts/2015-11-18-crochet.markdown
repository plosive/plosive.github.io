## Preface

Hi there! For christmas I decided to make a pair of fingerless gloves for my boyfriend (a computer programmer & piano player who is always cold). After much debate over what to have on them, I decided to go with the airbender arrow (from Avatar: The Last Air Bender) on black. I looked around at some patterns for guys but didn't find any that were quite satisfactory, so I decided to mix-n-match the bits I liked from various patterns & do some improv to get what I wanted.

A few years ago I made a pair of fingerless gloves for myself using the "Idony Fingerless Gloves" pattern from Ravelry ([See!](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/thedautoforegon/idony-fingerless-gloves)). I really liked this pattern, speicifcally the increase in the palm/thumb area, but it's a bit too feminine for what I'm goin for. I found another pattern specifically for men's gloves & I very much liked the cuff from that pattern.

I felt that if I made an arrow & then sewed it on it would be too bulky, so I did some experimenting to figure out how to make an arrow - so please let me know if my directions don't make sense. Here is a chart I made to help explain - it only shows 1/2 of the glove - specifically the part that deals with the arrow: [arrow chart](../../../../static/img/Posts/Gloves/arrow-chart.png)

I wanted to make sure the seam was on the outside edge of the hand, so I decided to use this seamless method, which involves working back & forth as if you were working rows instead of in the round (See Notes/References below). So, **please keep in mind** if you're using this pattern & want to use another method in order to work in the round you will have to do every other line of instructions in reverse!

## Airbender Fingerless Gloves

### Stitches & Terms

* ch = chain
* ss = slip stitch
* sc = single crochet
* bls = single crochet in back loop only
* inc = increase (two sc in the same st)
* dec = decrease (aka sc2tog)
* [blk] = black yarn (my main colour)
* [blu] = blue yarn (colour of arrow)

### Materials

* Yarn : acrylic cause i'm broke as hell
* Hooks: **F** (3.75mm) & **G** (4.25mm)
* Stitch markers (I use coloured paper clips)

### Guage/Finished Measurements/Sizing

So although I've been knitting & crocheting for many years, I still struggle with guage - I usually just kind of wing it. Also, i do a lot of amigurumi - when it doesn't matter. So I did my best to measure my guage and it seems to be 9 sts x 10 rws for a 2" square. But I HIGHLY suggest that you don't get hung up on this & just do whatever works best for you.

I have, however, measured the finished product (measurements reference image below). If you're making these as a present, I suggest taking some measurements and altering the pattern accordingly. I found this image & some other helpful info [here](http://bynumber19.com/2013/03/18/tutorial-measurements-fingerles-crochet-mittens/).
  * bottom of cuff to tip of fingers is 7.5"
  * A-C: ~4"-5"
  * D: 3" (2" of ribbing & 1" of sc)
  * E: 4.5"

### Notes/References

As I mentioned, much of this pattern is kind of a patchwork of bits of other patterns. I have slightly rephrased & altered some directions in order to reflect what I did. Check out the original patterns here:

  * Part 1 is from [Men's Crocheted Fingerless Gloves](http://www.myrecycledbags.com/2012/01/02/mens-crocheted-fingerless-gloves/) by Cindy (aka RecycleCindy)
  * Most of Part 3 all of Part 4 are from [Idony Fingerless Gloves](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/idony-fingerless-gloves) by Sarah
  * As mentioned above, I used Futuregirl's [seamless single crochet tutorial](http://www.futuregirl.com/craft_blog/2009/1/tutorial-seamless-single-crochet-better.aspx)

## Directions

### Pt 1: Cuff Ribbing

This is worked in normal rows using the **F** hook with [blk].

- Leave a long tail & ch 11.
- Row 1: sc in 2nd ch from hook & in each st down to the end. (10)
- Row 2-30: ch 1, bls in each st across (10)
- Repeat row 2 until desired length is reached - I did about 30 rows to make a cuff approx 6.5" around.
  - Leave yarn attached & slip hook out of last st to weave closed the cuff.
- Using the long tail from the beginning, weave closed the cuff by joining the first & last rows.
  - Cindy suggets working in the back loop of the last row & both loops of first row to keep the appearance of the back loop raised stitching.

### Pt 2: Seamless Tutorial

(This is used for the Pt 3: Glove Body) Here is my summary of how to join rows/rnds. As mentioned above, I highly suggest you check out [Futuregirl's tutorial](http://www.futuregirl.com/craft_blog/2009/1/tutorial-seamless-single-crochet-better.aspx); it is incredibly helpful.

  * marking the first & last sc in each row with st markers will be incredibly helpful.
  * sc 1 fewer sts than you want to end up with, as the ss that joins each row will take up the space of one sc.
  * ss into the first sc of the row.
  * turn, moving your work so the right side (most recently made sts) passes toward you and becomes the left side. Always turn in this direction.
  * ch 1, skip the ss that you just made, make next sc (which is the first st of this row) in the last sc of the previous row.
  * continue around to complete row. The last st should be made on top of the first st of the previous row (the first st marker).
  * repeat

### Pt 3: Glove Body

**Colour** For all rnds except rnd 3, 19, & 27 continue with the same colour yarn as the st you are working in. Rnd 3 is when to join the arrow color. We want it to go straight up until rnd 19, the base of the arrow head. If nothing is mentioned in the directions about colour, assume you'll be continuing up the colours from the previous rnd.

Here's a chart to help explain the arrow incs & decs: [color chart](../../../../static/img/Posts/Gloves/arrow-chart.png)

- Rnd 1: Slip the **F** hook back into last st of cuff. [blk] Sc evenly along end sts of cuff (30)
  - See Pt 2 for instructions
- Rnd 2: [blk] using **G** hook, st in each st. (30)
- Rnd 3: [blk] sc in next 5 sts, [join blu] sc in next 5 sts, [blk] sc around. (30)
- Rnd 4-6: sc around continuing colours from previous row - [blk] in [blk], [blu] in [blu] (30)
- Rnd 7: sc in next 14 sts, inc, sc, inc, sc around. (32 - 3 between markers)
    - **IMPORTANT**  Place a stitch marker in the 1st sc of the first inc & the 2nd sc of the second inc. Continue to move your markers up every row. Any time you inc at marker, place markers in new row in this manner.
    - These increases will create the extra room for the palm/thumb.
- Rnd 8: sc around & inc at each marker. (34 - 5 between markers)
- Rnd 9: sc around & inc at each marker. (36 - 7 between markers)
- Rnd 10: sc around. (36)
- Rnd 11-18: repeat rnd 8 & 10. (rnd 18: 44 - 15 between markers)
- Rnd 19: [blk] sc in next 2 sts, [blu] sc in next 11 sts, [blk] sc around. (44)
  - This is the base of the aarow head.
- Rnd 20: [blk] sc around, in last blk st before arrow, inc, [blu] dec, sc in next 7 sts, dec, [blk] inc, sc aroud. (44)
  - **arrow dec** in order to get the aarow head shape without loosing stitches, for each arrow dec rnd, you will inc in the [blk] stitch on either side & dec the first & last [blu] sts.
- Rnd 21: sc around. (44)
- Rnd 22: (Thumb division) sc until 1st marker, ch 4 & rejoin 13 sts along; arrow dec (see above) (33)
- Rnd 23: sc around. (33)
- Rnd 24-25: sc in ea st, arrow dec, sc around. (33)
- Rnd 26: sc in ea st, aarow dec (32)
  - for the aarow dec here, st the first & middle blu st together, then st the middle & last blu st together; going from 3 to 2 sts.
- Rnd 27: [blk] sc around (32)
- continue rnd 27 untill desired length is reached.
- add an edging bind off or split for finger holes with ch-4s (or a different length to better suit your hand size)
- (for fingers) join at each ch-4 & sc around untill desired length is reached
  - sc in only 1 loop of the dividing chain so you can use the other loop to do the next finger

### Pt 4: Thumb
Join next to first chain on palm of glove.

- Rnd 1: sc around until reach chain – sc2tog twice (15sts)
- Rnd 2: sc around until reach previous sc2tog – sc2tog (14sts)
- Rnd 3-end: Sc around until reaches desired length. Bind off.

Repeat for second glove.

Wow, I finially finished writing this! It's been months since I made these & I'm just getting around to finishing this post. My boyfriend loved the gloves & wore them all winter! Yay!

Ok, well I hope that all made sense! If it didn't, please don't hesitate to contact me for clarification! I'm [http://www.ravelry.com/people/thedautoforegon](thedautoforegon) on Ravelry. Have Fun!
